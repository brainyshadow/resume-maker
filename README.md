>How was it built?
 Resume Maker was made using <b>React<b>, <b>Flask API<b>, <b>mongoDB<b>, <b>Google's reCAPTCHA<b>, and <b>pdfkit</b>. 

>When will it be deployed?
 Sadly, the API developed for resume maker requires extensive cloud computing resources. This is because the pdf's are generated server side. As of right now, Resume Maker does not generate any revenue and cannot therefor pay for the cloud computing. If a way to generate revenue is found, the service will be deployed.
