 <h3>How was it built?</h3>

> Resume Maker was made using <b>React<b>, <b>Flask API<b>, <b>mongoDB<b>, <b>Google's reCAPTCHA<b>, and <b>pdfkit</b>.  
 
 <h3>When will it be deployed?</h3>

> Right now, the template to PDF conversion is done using a Python library known as PDFKit. Using this, all resumes need to be generated by the API. To make the API calls faster and less demanding a client side PDF generation is being developed so that the API returns the HTML to the client and then the PDF is generated on the client side. Once ready, resume generator will be published.
